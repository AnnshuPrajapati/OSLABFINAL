    Disk Scheduling Algorithm
</strong></h2>
            <p><t>Disk scheduling algorithms are the algorithms that are used for scheduling a disk. Generally, the scheduling refers to a time-table for completing any task or a job. With the help of the operating system, disk scheduling is performed. We use disk scheduling to schedule the Input/output requests that arrive for the disk.  

                In other words, we can define disk scheduling as a method that is used by the OS (operating system) to schedule the next upcoming requests. Disk Scheduling is also called Input/output scheduling.

                <br>
                Disk scheduling is important because of the following reasons:
                <br>
                <br>
                The slowest part of the computer system is the hard drive. So, to access the hard drive conveniently or effectively, we need disk scheduling.
                There may be chances that two or more requests can be distant from each other. Therefore, more disk arm movement can happen. Thus, we need disk scheduling for such handling case
                Sometimes, there are various I/O requests which arrive from the different processes. But at a time, the disk controller can only serve one I/O request. So, in this way, the other requests have to wait in the waiting queue, and scheduling is needed for those processes that are waiting in the waiting queue..</t></p>
